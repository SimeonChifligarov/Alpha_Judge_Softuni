# 📚 06_02_Polymorphism_and_Abstraction_Exercise

Welcome to the **Polymorphism and Abstraction - Exercise** repository! 🎉  
This section focuses on advancing your skills with **Polymorphism** and **Abstraction**, two pillars of robust
object-oriented programming. 🧠🐍✨

You’ll solve problems that challenge you to design abstract classes, override methods, and create flexible structures
where different objects can be treated in a uniform way. Perfect practice for real-world OOP systems! 🚀
