# 📚 04_02_Multidimensional_Lists_Exercise_1

Welcome to the **Multidimensional Lists - Exercise 1** repository! 🎉  
This section features a collection of deeper challenges to strengthen your mastery of **2D lists** (matrices) in Python.
Practice working with diagonals, nested iterations, index validation, and game-like simulations involving movement,
destruction, and dynamic updates. 🧠🧩💣🐍
