# 📚 06_01_Algorithms_Introduction_Lab

Welcome to the **Algorithms Introduction - Lab** repository! 🎉  
This section is your first step into the world of **algorithms**! You'll practice both recursive logic and classic
sorting/searching techniques. It's all about building your intuition for efficiency, structure, and problem-solving in
Python. 🧠🧮🚀
